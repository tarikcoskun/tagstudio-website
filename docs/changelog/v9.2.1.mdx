title: Alpha v9.2.1
date: 2024-05-23

### Added
- Basic thumbnail/preview support for RAW images (currently `.raw`, `.dng`, `.rw2`, `.nef`, `.arw`, `.crw`, `.cr3`)
  - NOTE: These previews are currently slow to load given the nature of rendering them. In the future once thumbnail caching is added, this process should only happen once.
- Thumbnail/preview support for HEIF images

### Fixed
- Fixed sidebar not expanding horizontally
- Fixed "Recent Library" list not updating when creating a new library
- Fixed palletized images not loading with alpha channels
- Low resolution images (such as pixel art) now render with crisp edges in thumbnails and previews
- Fixed visual bug where the edit icon would show for incorrect fields
